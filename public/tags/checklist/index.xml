      <description>When data publishers publish checklists, they will use a a Darwin Core Archive Taxon Core. And although the taxon core terms are already described here, what exactly to put in which field can sometimes be confusing. And there is a lot to read, like here https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/issues/1
Here I am sharing a summary of an email conversation we had with some data publishers on Helpdesk concerning some of the Taxon Core fields.</description>

      <title>(Almost) everything you want to know about the GBIF Species API</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-species-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we are talking about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/developer/species&#34;&gt;GBIF Species API&lt;/a&gt;. Although you might not use it directly, you probably encountered it while using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/&#34;&gt;GBIF web portal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing a scientific name in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?occurrence_status=present&amp;amp;q=&#34;&gt;GBIF Occurrence search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing a &amp;ldquo;Taxon Match Fuzzy&amp;rdquo; flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/tools/species-lookup&#34;&gt;Species Name matching tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API is what allow us to navigate through the names available on GBIF. I will try to avoid repeating what you can already find in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/developer/species&#34;&gt;its documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I will attempt to give an overview and answer some questions that we received in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to choose a dataset class on GBIF?</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/choose-dataset-type/</link>

      <description>If you are a (first time) publisher on GBIF and you are trying to decide which type of dataset would best fit your data, this blogpost is for you.
All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &amp;ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&amp;rdquo;). The dataset&amp;rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&amp;rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:</description>

      <title>Six questions answered about the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-backbone-taxonomy/</link>

      <description>This past week our informatics team has been updating the Backbone taxonomy on GBIF.org. This is a fairly disruptive process which sometimes involves massive taxonomic changes but DONâ€™T PANIC.
This update is a good thing. It means that some of the taxonomic issues reported have been addressed (see for example this issue concerning the Xylophagidae family) and that new species are now visible on GBIF. Plus, it gives me an excellent opportunity to talk about the GBIF backbone taxonomy and answer some of the questions you might have.</description>
